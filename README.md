# EY-RoleBridgeAI-G11
Connecting skills to future roles with Artificial Intelligence.


Business Context
Enterprises need agile talent strategies to stay competitive in a rapidly changing market. Traditional HR systems often fail to map evolving skills to open roles or provide actionable upskilling paths. This gap creates inefficiencies in workforce planning and limits career growth opportunities. AI agents can automate these processes at scale, but they introduce risks around bias, explainability, and data privacy. A successful solution must combine intelligent automation with strong governance and transparency.

Problem Description
Design an AI-driven talent strategy agent that:

·       Maps skills from employee profiles to open roles.

·       Generates personalized upskilling plans to close skill gaps.

·       Provides clear, human-readable explanations for recommendations.

·       Incorporates risk mitigation features, including:

·       Bias detection and fairness checks in role recommendations.

·       Explainable AI for why a role or learning path was suggested.

·       Data privacy safeguards for sensitive HR information.

The solution should balance accuracy, fairness, and transparency, while considering scalability for large organizations.
